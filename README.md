## Problem
Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are gaining popularity in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. They are a form of self-governance that enables members to vote on proposals and make decisions without the need for centralized authority. However, one of the challenges faced by DAOs is low participation in voting, which can result in decision-making bottlenecks. To solve this problem,we have created VoteAPP that incentivize members to vote on proposals through rewards and badges. 

## Incentivizing Voting
The idea behind incentivizing voting is to encourage DAO members to actively participate in decision-making by providing rewards for their contributions. The rewards will come in the form of tokens, which can be used within the DAO's ecosystem . By providing incentives, the users can increase participation rates and ensure that decisions are made by a diverse group of members with different perspectives.

## Designing the App

To create an VoteApp a incentivizes voting, the following features should are included:

1) Proposal Listings: The app display a list of proposals that are currently up for voting. Each proposal should have a brief description, its status (open/closed), and the number of votes received so far.

2) Rewards System: The smartcontract have a system that tracks and awards tokens to members who vote on proposals. The rewards system should be transparent and accessible to all members, so they can see how many tokens they have earned and how many they need to earn to reach the next reward leve


## Benefits of Incentivizing Voting

By incentivizing voting through rewards,app can provide the following benefits: 1. Increased Participation: Members are more likely to participate in decision-making when there are incentives involved. By providing rewards and recognition, the app can increase participation rates and ensure that decisions are made by a diverse group of members. 2. More Informed Decisions: When more members participate in voting, the decisions made are likely to be more informed and representative of the DAO's values and goals. 3. Better Engagement: VoteAPP can increase member engagement by providing a platform for discussion and debate around proposals. This can help to create a more cohesive and collaborative community.
